    <p>Reilly is not your average teenager. While many people spend their free time scrolling through social media or hanging out with friends, Reilly has found a unique and rewarding way to spend her time: babysitting dogs. For Reilly, dogs are more than just pets—they’re furry friends who bring joy, laughter, and a sense of purpose to her life. Whether it’s taking them for walks, playing fetch, or simply cuddling on the couch, Reilly has turned her love for dogs into a meaningful hobby that benefits both her and her four-legged clients.</p>
